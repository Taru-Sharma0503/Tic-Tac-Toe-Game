# Tic-Tac-Toe Game 🎮❌⭕

## Introduction
This is a simple command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Python. Two players can play against each other, taking turns to place their mark (X or O) on a 3x3 board. The game displays the board after each move and checks for a winner after every turn. If all positions are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw 🤝. It also handles invalid inputs and prevents players from placing a mark on an already occupied position. This project is a fun way to practice Python basics such as loops, conditionals, functions, and input validation.

2.Save the script as tic_tac_toe.py.

3.Run the game using:
